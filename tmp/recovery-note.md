# Icon Recovery Status

## Completed:
- ✅ Clean data structure implemented in `src/data/raw/`
- ✅ Updated configuration with accurate icon counts
- ✅ Fixed library imports and dependencies
- ✅ Removed corrupted root files
- ✅ Restored working libraries: Lucide, Radix, Feather, Bootstrap, CSS.gg, Boxicons, Remix, Phosphor, Fluent

## Current Status:
The architecture is now clean and working with the following libraries:
- **Material Design**: Structure ready (needs complete data extraction)
- **Tabler**: Structure ready (needs complete data extraction)  
- **IconNoir**: Working with sample data
- **Solar**: Working with sample data
- **Teeny**: Working with sample data
- **Ant Design**: Working with sample data

## Next Steps for Full Recovery:
1. Extract complete SVG data from backup files:
   - `tmp/material-complete.ts` → `src/data/raw/material-icons-raw.ts` (7000+ icons)
   - `TrablerStroke.ts` → `src/data/raw/tabler-icons-raw.ts` (4968 icons)

2. Populate other libraries with complete data from working source files

## Total Icons Available:
- Current working: ~15,000+ icons
- After complete extraction: ~50,000+ icons

The foundation is solid and ready for complete data population.
